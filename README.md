# Pokémon Emerald Refined

<img align="right" src="./docs/assets/emerald.png" height="200px" alt="refined-logo">

This project represents a [decompilation] of the [Pokémon Emerald] video game,
undertaken with the intention of creating a [ROM Hack].

The primary objective of this ROM Hack is to elevate the _challenge_ and
_gameplay_ elements while retaining the nostalgic essence of the original game.

## Changes Made

I've identified specific elements that, do not contribute positively to the
gameplay experience:

- TBD

## What Remains Unchanged

While various features might enhance subsequent Pokémon titles, we've chosen to
maintain the original charm of Gen 3 with the following decisions:

- No introduction of new Pokémon
- No addition of new types
- No creation of new moves
- No incorporation of new abilities
- Retention of single-use TMs
- No [Physical/Special split]
