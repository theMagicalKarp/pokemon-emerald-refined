<img align="right" src="./docs/assets/emerald.png" height="200px" alt="refined-logo">

This project represents a [decompilation] of the [Pokémon Emerald] video game,
undertaken with the intention of creating a [ROM Hack].

The primary objective of this ROM Hack is to elevate the _challenge_ and
_gameplay_ elements while retaining the nostalgic essence of the original game.

While doing so, the project aims to be meticulous in preserving the sentimental
quality of the original game, ensuring that long-time fans and newcomers alike
can appreciate the journey. By introducing minor **quality of life
improvements**, opportunity for **increased challenge**, and **combat
balances** the ROM Hack aims to strike a balance between honoring the classic
gameplay and offering new experiences. This meticulous blend ensures that
players will encounter familiar moments intertwined with fun and exciting new
challenges.

## Changes Made

This project has identified specific elements that do not directly contribute to
the gameplay experience. By analyzing various components and aspects of the game
design, the project has pinpointed areas that might be superfluous or detract
from the core gaming experience.

The aim is to refine and optimize the game's design, ensuring that players receive
a fun and engaging experience.

- Display [Nature Stat Modifiers] in the Pokémon Summary
  - Frequently, it's frustrating to have to remember or look up natures to
    determine how a Pokémon's stats will be affected.

## What Remains Unchanged

While various features might enhance subsequent Pokémon titles, the project has
chosen to maintain the original charm of Gen 3 with the following decisions.

These decision ensures that long-time fans can relive their cherished memories
while also introducing newer generations to the gameplay that defined this era
of Pokémon games. Additionally, we've focused on refining gameplay mechanics
that resonate with the core essence of Gen 3, such as the iconic Pokémon
abilities and the intricate balance between various types.

- No introduction of new Pokémon
- No addition of new types
- No creation of new moves
- No incorporation of new abilities
- Retention of single-use TMs
- No [Physical/Special split]
